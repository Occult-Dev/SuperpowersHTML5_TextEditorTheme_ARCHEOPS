##HOW TO INSTALL

- open your superpowers game **engine** folder [ where *`superpowers.exe`* is ]
- go to `resources`, `app`, `systems`, `game`, `plugins`, `common`, `textEditorWidget`, `public`
- copy the **`widget.css`** from this repo, and paste it into that folder.

Overwrite the current `widget.css` file that is already in there

[ ***AT YOUR OWN RISK***, of course! I'm not responsible if your entire computer explodes! ...unlikely, but you should still proceed with caution: ***MAKE A BACKUP OF `widget.css` BEFORE OVERWRITTING IT!*** ]
